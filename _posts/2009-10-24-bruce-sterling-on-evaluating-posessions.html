<blockquote>He talks about clearing your life of posessions, how you should divide everything into four categories: 1. Beautiful things. 2. Things with emotional value. 3. Functional things. 4. Everything else. <br /><br />
Divide each category into the things you keep and the things you get rid of. In category 1, you can keep it if it&#39;s on display in your house, if you show it to your friends, if you share it. If not, then you don&#39;t need it, it&#39;s taking up space and time, which you&#39;re paying for with your money, time and health. Take a picture, put it on a thumb drive, take it everywhere with you and get rid of the original. In category 2, if it has a compelling story, one that you actually tell people, you can keep it. In category 3, unless it&#39;s very good at what it does and it does something you do a lot of, it goes. And of course everything in category 4 goes.<br /><br />
He says you shouldn&#39;t try to do this in normal times. Wait until a spouse dies, a divorce, a child is born or a child leaves home. Wait till you move. It pays to figure out now what you want to do when that time comes.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave</a> shares a talk from Bruce Sterling about how to evaluate your possessions, and clear your life of the clutter. My family and I are in the middle of a move right now, packing our life into boxes and bags, preparing to spend several months in a temporary location while we work out something permanent. We&#39;re doing a lot of evaluating these days, and I think Bruce&#39;s system bears keeping in mind.</p>
