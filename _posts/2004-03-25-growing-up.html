Jim posts a <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/6808">great bit</a> about growing up. As geeks, we get really attached to our tools, the stuff we spend years in up to our virtual elbows, practicing our craft. These tools can, unfortunately, even crowd out &quot;real&quot; relationships - geeks are notoriously bad at prioritizing. smile

I&#39;ve been through the same process that Jim describes, with the same software. Frontier was my first development love affair, and the breakup was long and difficult. Jim helped me through that, just as he&#39;d helped me get started back in 1996. (You rock Jim!)

Jim was responding to this <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/babySquirrelsGrowUp">post</a> by Dave, and I agree with Jim&#39;s comments. This is a great post, and deserves to be on <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/default">DaveNet</a>.
