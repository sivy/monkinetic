I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of writing a python library for Apple&#39;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote">Keynote</a> file format, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2067.html">APXL</a>.

After slogging through 4 objects and realizing that to do it right was going to be a LONG process, I started looking around for code generators that might read an XML Schema (which Apple provides for APXL - see the above link) and spit out python code.

Well, here it is: <a href="http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html">generateDS</a> - generate data structures from XSL.

It seems fast enough, though I&#39;ve had to hack it a good bit to work around Apple&#39;s element names, many of which have dashes in them (ie, &#39;font-styling&#39;,&#39;outlined-drawable-style-type&#39;) and are not valid python identifier names. So I had to add a function to remove the dashes and camelCase them, then make sure that the code calls my function every time it uses the name. I also modifed it to not put &quot;get&quot; in front of get accessors, but that&#39;s personal preference.

Still, it spits out 3500 lines of python in about .75 seconds. Once I&#39;ve got it tweaked and played around with it some, I&#39;ll post the code.
