> If I could go back in time 3 years I'd tell myself that the red jacket is going to make me look like an asshole. Then I'd slap myself and point out that flexible grids and flexible images are great, but ultimately I should be focused on making things truly scalable by thinking twice before I used pixel values in my CSS.

Trent has a great quote from [Andy Hume](http://blog.andyhume.net/responsive-by-default/), too:

>If you think about it, responsive layout is not a new thing. Open a simple HTML file in a web browser, and the content automatically adapts to fit the width of that browser. The web is responsive on its own—by default. It's us that's been breaking it all these years by placing content in fixed-width containers.

I don't spend a lot of time these days on the front end, but I'm going to be thinking about this the next time I am.
