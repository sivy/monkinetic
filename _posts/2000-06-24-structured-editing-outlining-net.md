Title: Structured Editing, Outlining, .NET

**Pike**

I am once again editing this site in &quot;Pike&quot;. Yay! Now I have to review how to write rules, so I can get my rules set up right on this machine. (My iBook.)  Rules are now working. Now that I&#39;m in Pike again, it&#39;s like being in Frontier (actually, those in the know will make the case that I _am_ in Frontier...) &quot;;->&quot;. I have my HTML menu, and my outliner, and because I know how, I can customize Pike to do *whatever I want it to*.

**Outlining your ear off**

No doubt about it, outlining makes me a much more prolific writer. I find it so much easier to express myself in a structured editor.

Speaking of structured editors, I was describing &quot;Frontier&quot; to another developer this evening, and he just nodded the whole time, until I got to Frontier&#39;s outliner. Describing the process of editing code in an outline to him, I watched his face light up. I love that! I expressed to him, as I do to every developer I expound to, that if only I could get a scriptable outline code editor that would do syntax highlighting, I could stop IDE shopping.

Just to prove I could do it, I got Frontier talking via Applescript to Sun&#39;s javac the other day, and was writing Java code in the outliner, and compiling it in javac. Yum!

**Resumes and Headhunters**

I&#39;ve had my resume up on my site for a long time. I&#39;m not looking for a job, but I think of my resume as a publicly available doument, a reference of sorts.

Lately I&#39;ve started getting emails from people I can only assume are headhunters saying they saw my resume online, I have skills they&#39;re looking for, and have a great opportunity for me if I&#39;ll contact them. Java is big (though if they looked closely they would see that my resume says _JavaScript_), as is eCommerce. The couple I actually talked to (they called me at work, no less) wanted to know all about what kind of work I&#39;m doing, what tools I use, but were very slow to offer details about the opportunities they have to offer. Oh- I also blew off someone I thought was an annoying headhunter, but on reflection was probably just a desperate corporate recruiter.

I don&#39;t know what brings them out of the woodwork. Nothing has really changed for me in the last few months, that I can think of. Somehow I got on some recruiter&#39;s list, and they&#39;re all pitching me, hoping someone will get me to swing.

I&#39;ve changed my resume, so it expicitly states that I&#39;m not currently seeking a change of employment. _My boss will be happy to hear it_. Maybe it&#39;ll get them to leave me alone. But I doubt it.

**Microsoft &quot;.Net&quot;**

Chatting with [Josh Lucas][1] the other day, I wondered aloud (well, in print, er, IM) about &quot;Microsoft&quot;&#39;s new &quot;.Net&quot; (&quot;dot-net&quot;) strategy. I think this is a big chance for Microsoft to do some great, _open_, things for both developers and consumers.

The [technology][2] is there, to be open, and amazingly powerful. But it&#39;s also published, and visible. Lock-in will be harder - not impossible - but harder, no matter _what_ [Bill says][3]. (Look about half-way down, for Bill&#39;s comment&#39;s about second-class citizens. _He burns me up sometimes._)

But in typical MS style, the strategy may be too [Microsoft-centered][4]. Even the name breathes arrogance, presuming to usurp the &quot;.net&quot; top-level domain moniker for the name of the platform. Come on, guys.
