Another app I&#39;ve come to appreciate on the Mac is [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom), a full-screen writing environment - nothing but blackness, green lettering, and you.

So I went looking for something I can use here at work, and sure enough, someone has cloned WriteRoom for Windows and called it [DarkRoom](http://they.misled.us/dark-room). Nice!
