Title: Boxpub
Date: 2014-09-02 22:16


2 weeks after [Markbox](http://markbox.io) went down, this site is now running on Markbox "lite" - [boxpub](http://github.com/sivy/boxpub).

Boxpub is a simplified, waaaaay stripped down (it's like 2 files, and could be one), reimplementation of parts of Markbox --
the parts that really solve the problem -- write a post on Dropbox, it gets published. It doesn't have to be harder than that.
