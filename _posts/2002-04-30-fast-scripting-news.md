Title: Fast Scripting News
layout: post

<img align="right" border="1" src="http://media.redmonk.net/images/snFast.jpg" />Dave has put up a fast loading version of Scripting News, as their static server is down. I have to admit whenever I see this version of Scripting News, I&#39;m taken back to 1996, &#39;97 when SN was small and fast. It makes me want to rip the images off my site and strip it down to nothing. <i>FAST FAST FAST!</i>
