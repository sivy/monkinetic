Is Dave becoming a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/02/15#warForOil">warblogger</a>? -)

Paulo Valdemarin <a href="http://paolo.evectors.it/2003/02/15.html#a1389">writes</a>:<blockquote>Saddam Hussein has to step down and possibly to respond for what he has done, no doubt about it.</blockquote>
From what I&#39;ve read of his site, Paulo seems like a smart guy with good ideas. But I don&#39;t see Saddam just stepping down any time soon. <a href="http://www.scrappleface.com/MT/archives/000663.html">Then again</a>...

The new U2 song, <a href="http://www.u2tour.de/discographie/lyrics/The_Hands_That_Built_America.html">The Hands That Built America</a>, from Scorsese&#39;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0217505">Gangs of New York</a> is really good. Inspiring and haunting.

Ok, time for a second cup. -)

<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100490/">Bill Bumgarner</a> noticed <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/02/14#item1826">my post</a> about the &quot;Super-Villain Switch Ad&quot; and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100490/2003/02/15.html#a397">comments on his own difficulties</a> getting Linux/KDE to run. Doesn&#39;t sound like fun. I, too, like a unix desktop that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">just works</a>.

Dave likes <a href="http://search.userland.com/?t=or&amp;m=10&amp;s=1&amp;q=West+Wing">West Wing</a>. Me, I&#39;m growing to like <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Mister_Sterling/about/index.html">Mr. Sterling</a>.
