As described in [my last post](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/11/29/adobes-kuler-api-exposed/), I&#39;ve been working on documenting the kuler REST API. Last night I whipped up an RSS feed for any user&#39;s themes. You&#39;ll have to visit [the page](http://deliciouslymeta.com/kuler/) and login to get the link, but after that the feed will work even without logging in.

I also created a page that just grabs a single theme - each theme in the feed now links to this page as a permalink. Finally, I figured out the download url and the feed description should contain the ASE download link.
