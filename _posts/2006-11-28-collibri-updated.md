[Collibri](http://colibri.leetspeak.org/) is a poor-man&#39;s (read Windows-user&#39;s) [QuickSilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/), which I use on my Windows machine at work. It&#39;s got few prefs to speak of, can&#39;t find half my apps, but it&#39;s better than nothing.

So anyway, version 17a is out.
