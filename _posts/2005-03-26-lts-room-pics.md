Title: LTs Room Pics
layout: post

This past weekend and week, |Jodi| and I spent a lot of time working to finally finish LT&#39;s room. Following are the results...

The crib and new bedding we found. Note the 5-color checkerboard pattern we *painted* on the walls. Cool, eh?

The room and antique dresser we stripped and repainted:
