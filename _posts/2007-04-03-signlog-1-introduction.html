I&#39;ve wanted to try this for a while, and is one of the few reasons I&#39;d put myself on camera on this site. :-) I&#39;m going to start a signing vlog, and I&#39;ll try to post whenever I can.

<p id="SL1_320x240.flv"><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">Get the Flash Player</a> to see this player.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
 var FO = { movie:&quot;https://media.dreamhost.com/mediaplayer.swf&quot;,width:&quot;320&quot;,height:&quot;240&quot;,majorversion:&quot;7&quot;,build:&quot;0&quot;,bgcolor:&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;,
            flashvars:&quot;file=http://www.redmonk.net/files/signinglog/SL1_320x240.flv&amp;showdigits=true&amp;autostart=false&quot; };
UFO.create(FO,&quot;SL1_320x240.flv&quot;);
</script>

I&#39;ll transpose it later when I&#39;m not feeling stupid. Feel free to comment, post corrections, etc. if you can understand my garbled signing. Cheers!

>Hi! My name is Steve Ivy. I&#39;m a student of ASL. Today I want to start a vlog about studying sign language, about what we&#39;re learning, watching, seeing, talking about, etc.

>Tonight in class we watched &quot;[Through Deaf Eyes](http://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/)&quot;. It&#39;s a movie, well, a documentary, from PBS about the history of Deaf Culture. Tonight we watched half the movie, it was *really* interesting! I&#39;m excited to see the second half of the movie on... Wednesday.

>Ok, that&#39;s enough for my first try! Thanks!
