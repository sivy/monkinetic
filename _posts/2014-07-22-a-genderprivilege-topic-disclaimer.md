Title: 'A gender/privilege topic disclaimer'

For future reference:

*Disclaimer: I've never written about gender and privilege topics - I'm a hetero white male who grew up in a suburban, anglo, Christan, two-parent family in the 70s and 80s when such things were (to me) normal. I didn't go through much of a rebellious stage (barring a couple of years of slightly-over-drinking, hair-coloring and ear-piercings that didn't offend, literally, anyone).*

*As John Scalzi would put it, my life has been basically lived on the [lowest difficuly setting](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/) and I've been fortunate due to no particular effort on my own part. Please forgive statements made as fact that are obvious to you to be side-effects of this phenomenon, and please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:steveivy@gmail.com) with any feedback.*
