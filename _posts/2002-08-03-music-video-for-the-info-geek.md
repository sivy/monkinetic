Title: Music video for the info geek
layout: post

[Via <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000463">Aaron</a>] Music video from Royksopp, &quot;You Remind Me&quot;. The video is done in classic &quot;infopgraphic&quot; style, following an office worker&#39;s day. This is one of the most innovative things I&#39;ve seen in ages, even if the music is fairly classic euro-techno-pop. (Catchy though).
