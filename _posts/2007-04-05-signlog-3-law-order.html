>Good morning! Last night, Jodi and I watched Law and Order: Criminal Intent. It was a good show I think - it had a lot of Deaf actors. I had two problems with the plot. First, it showed, like, that deaf people hear *nothing* - silent. I think that&#39;s not really true.

>The second problem - the plot was not really that great - the writing was not great. I think the show&#39;s producers wanted to show a lot of different opinions about deaf culture, cochlear implants, etc., and then there was not a lot of time left for good plot development. :-)

>So... if you want to learn more about (this is for my hearing friends) if you want to learn more about how deaf people really hear/experience sound, you need to visit .

>For my hearing friends, if you want to learn more about what deaf people really hear, or can&#39;t hear, or what their world is like, visit , it&#39;s a group blog by a variety of deaf and hard of hearing people, and they discuss issues of... hearing aids, and how they hear things, and, whow they experience life. So, it&#39;s really interesting you should check it out.
