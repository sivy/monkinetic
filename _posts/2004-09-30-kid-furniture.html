Jodi and I found a small antique dresser that needs a bunch of work done on it. I&#39;ve already started stripping and sanding the old finish off, and we&#39;ll be painting it up to go with the (as yet to be determined) color scheme for LT&#39;s room. I&#39;m enjoying it too, as it gives me something special I can create/restore for my future son!

One of my few &quot;prized&quot; possessions is a cradle my grandfather made, that my brothers and I used as infants. He even hand-carved animals into the end panels, and carved our names and birthdates on the sides. LT will be a bit big for the cradle, but I&#39;m really hoping that he will be able to use it at least a bit.

So here&#39;s the dresser as it is now. Note the REDMONK license plate in the background. :-D
