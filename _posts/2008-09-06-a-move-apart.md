Title: A Move Apart
layout: post

I can finally (with sincere apologies to [Zeldman and crew](http://alistapart.com)) talk about new developments in my personal and professional life, and I'm stoked to do so!

For the last two years, I've been working for [GoDaddy.com](http://godaddy.com) as first a production designer, then as a front end developer for our ecommerce application. But for the last 10 years, my passion has been blogging, community, and content management. Over the last few months, I've felt that I was ready for a new direction professionally - one that would put me back in the middle of the kind of work I love - blogging and helping build blogging and community tools for cool clients. I've also felt that I was ready for a new direction personally - our kids are now being home schooled by [my amazingly talented wife](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net), and I want to have more time to focus on the family and helping Jodi with the up-training of little minds.

So, I'm excited to announce that I'm going to be joining [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com)'s team of [professional services developers and designers](http://sixapart.com/services), working with some sites [you may have heard of](http://apperceptive.com/what/), and helping to improve blogging in general and one [kick-ass blogging engine](http://movabletype.com) in particular.

The bonus is, I'm going to be working from home - "Six Apart Phoenix" will be my home office - which means I get back 2 hours a day that I won't be commuting. It also means that I'll be available more to my family, which is a great thing.

I've loved working with the team here at GoDaddy. It's a fast-moving company with some awesome people, many of whom I got to work with on a daily basis, and I'll miss them as I start on a new track.
