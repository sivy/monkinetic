Hello out there! Sorry for the lack of updates lately - a deadline at work is fast approaching, and I&#39;ve been putting me energies there, as well as <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/category/adoption-week-by-week/">our adoption</a>. But, so as to not leave all you folks in interweb-land in the dark, some highlights:

* It looks like we&#39;re going to make our Dec 22 deadline at work. Yay.
* A co-worker and I are going to a one-day course taught by Edward Tufte in late January. I am very excited about this. As well as getting to sit at the feet of the master, attendees also get his 3 books, the PowerPoint white paper, and a poster. Yum!
* About 2 months ago I started getting rather nasty, debilitating headaches. Not often, but with increasing frequency. Yesterday I finally got checked out by a doctor, who confirmed the migraine-like pathology and gave me some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatriptan">Imitrex</a> samples, and a promise to prescribe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptan">triptan</a> of my choice (the other candidate right now is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolmitriptan">Zomig</a>).
* I&#39;ve started using <a href="http://del.icio.us/redmonk">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a> as a quick-blog. Check it out or <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/redmonk">subscribe</a> if you want. Recent topics have included <a href="http://del.icio.us/redmonk/css">css</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/redmonk/ukraine">ukraine</a>.
