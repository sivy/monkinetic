I&#39;m finally back writing <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/CocoaTopics.html">Cocoa</a> code again. I&#39;ve already written (and temporarily abandoned) <a href="http://sid.redmonk.net">one app</a> in Apple&#39;s Cocoa Mac OS X programming environment. 

The project I&#39;m working on now is one I&#39;ve been ruminating on for 6 years. I won&#39;t be talking much more about it here until I get much further along the development cycle, but I mention it now so I can fawn over how cool Cocoa and Objective-C are.

 I&#39;m having more fun doing this than I&#39;ve had in ages, and I even when doing other things I find myself sketching object models, data models, GUI prototypes, and just generally obsessing. Wheee!
