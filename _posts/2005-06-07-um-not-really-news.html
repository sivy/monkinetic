|Dave Winer| said he was going to <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/06#When:12:11:32PM">have an exclusive</a> after the <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2005/06/06/waiting-on-the-stevenote/">SteveNote</a>. 

&gt;The announcement is over at 2PM Eastern, now the bits the others don&#39;t have: 1. Apple is not going into the software business, their operating system will not run on other vendor&#39;s hardware. So you won&#39;t be running the Mac OS on Dell, HP or IBM, for example. and 2. While Windows is not explicitly supported, they won&#39;t do anything to prevent Windows from running on their hardware. <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/06#When:2:12:48PM">#</a>

Well, 1. I think anyone putting 2 minutes thought into the idea knew this would be the case, so it&#39;s not really news, and 2. news.com <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+throws+the+switch%2C+aligns+with+Intel/2100-7341_3-5733756.html?tag=nl">beat Dave to the punch</a> by... at least 8 minutes. ;-)
