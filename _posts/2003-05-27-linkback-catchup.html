Well I used to try and make sure I&#39;d link to folks who were linking to me (according to Technorati), and I&#39;ve totally fallen down on the job. Mostly it&#39;s because I&#39;m lazy, but also because lately I&#39;ve only been getting links from the usual suspects (Seth, Bill, Greg - hi guys!) whom I link to fairly regularly.

Well, I&#39;ve had some new link in the last few weeks, so it&#39;s only fair I give a shout out to a few folks who, incredibly, found something to link to here. smile

The <a href="http://www.bigha.com/blog">BiGHA Weblog</a> is a blog by the guys who make the very interesting <a href="http://www.bigha.com/">BiGHA bike</a>. Inexplicably, they linked to monkinetic in conjuction with a post about Star Trek, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve discussed here in eons. (Lost interest a long time ago, and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0253754">Nemesis</a> was the nail in the coffin.) But hey, it&#39;s a link and that bike looks nifty!

Seth gets another ping for <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index/2003/05/20#TW3105">his link</a> to <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/05/21#item2133">my comments</a> on &#39;s new weblog search app. Seth and crew built and maintain Conversant, the best CMS you never heard of (and which kicks Manila&#39;s hiney from Woodside to Boston).

Lastly, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116000/">Coty&#39;s Radio Weblog</a> linked here regarding my post about the &quot;Piles&quot; UI feature rumored to be part of the new Mac OS X. Unfortunately, Coty&#39;s using <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>, which quotes my entire post but generates a link to the main site, not <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/04/17#item2054">the post itself</a>. (By the way, I found that link in about 3 seconds using my own - <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/05/21#item2133">Google-less</a> - <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic?body=piles">weblog search</a>. Nya nya.)
