Title: Cork'd, WLTV
layout: post

I&#39;ve been a huge fan of [Dan Cederholm](http://simlebits.com) for a long time. Dan helped started the wine community [Cork&#39;d](http://corkd.com) with [Dan Benjamin](http://hivelogic.com), which has been long supported ad-wise by Gary Vaynerchuk from [Wine Library TV](http://tv.winelibrary.com).

Yesterday the Dans announced that Cork&#39;d has been acquired by a new company with Gary at the lead, giving the site more resources and focus. It also means that Cork&#39;d will benefit from WL&#39;s huge library as it get imported into Cork&#39;d. So congrats to Dan and Dan!

However, the reason I wanted to post was to recommend Wine Library TV. Gary is a real east-coast ham, but he is obviously also passionate and extremely knowledgeable about wine. On top of that, he has a passion for helping real people find, understand, and appreciate wine.

I [signed up](http://corkd.com/people/redmonk/) with Cork&#39;d back when it launched, but have not kept up as I simply have no idea what wines to try/buy. Thanks to several episodes of WLTV, I now have several wines on my Cork&#39;d [shopping list](http://corkd.com/people/redmonk/shoppinglist) that I can&#39;t wait to try out. (As well as a couple that are not yet available in Cork&#39;d, so I need to note them separately - especially a couple of Portuguese wines. Mmm.)

So if you&#39;re looking to learn more about wine, head over to [Wine Library TV](http://tv.winelibrary.com) and check out a few episodes. You won&#39;t be disappointed!
