Title: Sid, Mac OS X weblog client for Conversant CMS
layout: post

<i>Sid</i> is a Mac OS X weblog client for the Conversant internet groupware product. More information about Conversant can be found here:<p>

http://www.free-conversant.com<p><b>Prerequisites</b>:<br />
1) You&#39;re running Mac OS X<br />
2) You have a site (conversation) at http://free-conversant.com (or you are running a site hosted by Macrobyte).

Sid will be available for download soon.

<b>What Sid can do</b>:<br />
1) Post messages to your conversant site. You&#39;ll need to know the zone name and conversation name. If you do not know these, you can post a message at http://support.free-conversant.com and the nice Conversant community will help out.<p>

2) Optionally add the message to a weblog on your site. Manage your list of weblogs.<p>

3) Sid saves your connection document as a .conv file, and you can have multiple documents open at once. Each one will post to the conversation identified in the settings.<p>

4) If an error occurs, a hseet will appear detailing the error. There&#39;s an option to &quot;email error report&quot;. Click the button to launch/switch Mail.app, add any comments you&#39;d like, and send it. I&#39;ll try to respond to bug reports quickly.<p>

5) Sid now lets you add italic, bold, underline, resources, and links to selected text in your post via the keyboard and menus.<p>

<b>What does Sid look like?</b>:<br />

I&#39;m glad you asked! These are old screenshots of Sid, I&#39;ll have new ones up soon, but for now this will give you an idea of what it&#39;s capable of.

Here&#39;s Sid&#39;s main window, on the &#39;Post&#39; tab:

Sid provides a &#39;Text&#39; menu with which you can add simple formatting and links to your post:<br />

Sid will let you see a preview, after a fashion, on the &#39;Preview&#39; tab:
<img align="center" border="1" src="http://media.redmonk.net/images/sid/previewTab.jpg" />

In order to post to your conversation, you&#39;ll need to enter a few important settings:

Sid maintains a history of your past posts, and lets you select one and edit it by clicking the &#39;Edit Post&#39; button:
