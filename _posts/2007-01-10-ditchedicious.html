I&#39;ve ditched [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/redmonk), and imported all my links into <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/SteveIvy" rev="vote-for">ma.gnolia</a>, based largely on an interview with [Tara Hunt](http://www.horsepigcow.com/) (of community marketing studio [Citizen Agency](http://citizenagency.com/)) by [Brian Oberkirch](http://www.brianoberkirch.com/?p=787). The site is very nicely designed, the link bookmarklet works well, and they have ratings on links. (Hm, Perhaps I should recommend they add [vote-links](http://microfrmats.org/wiki/vote-links) support...)

She talked about the work CA did with Ma.gnolia, and the focus that Ma.gnolia has put on design, experience, and on their core audience of Mac designers and developers. Definitely check out the interview, and give [ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia/) a shot.

(My Ma.gnolia links have also replaced del.icio.us in the lifestream, [DELICIOUSLYMETA](http://deliciouslymeta.com))
