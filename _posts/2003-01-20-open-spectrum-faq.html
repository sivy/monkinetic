<a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/index.html">David Weinberger</a> has put together a <a href="http://www.greaterdemocracy.org/OpenSpectrumFAQ.html">really good FAQ</a> about the Open Spectrum movement. It&#39;s well done, and gives a glimpse of what spectrum de-regulation might do for us.

For another glimpse of the unwired future, we now turn to blogger and NetFiction (NeFi) author <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Cory Doctorow</a>, whose work <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/index.html">Liberation Spectrum</a> is well written, and worth checking out.
