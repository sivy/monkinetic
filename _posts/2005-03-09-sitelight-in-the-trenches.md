Ok, I gave up on getting Kevin on the line for some audio. Maybe at a later time I can add it back in.

Today&#39;s SiteLight is on Kevin Devin&#39;s <a href="http://kevindevin.com/">weblog</a> and In The Trenches podcast.

###What is this site?

In The Trenches, <a href="http://kevindevin.com">http://kevindevin.com</a>, is Kevin Devin&#39;s weblog and the home of the &quot;In The Trenches&quot; and &quot;In The Trenches: Tech Chat&quot; podcasts. Kevin is a system administrator for a company in Redmond, WA (no, not *that* company).
