Short version: pystatsd is fire-and-forget site metrics from python, using Etsy's StatsD and Graphite.

The brilliant devops folks at [Etsy](http://etsy.com) released (and [posted about](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/)) an awesome little node.js-based stats server called [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/).

Statsd sits in front of the [Graphite metrics server](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), providing a simple API for applications to send stats *over UDP*. UDP is "old tech" but is fire-and-forget -- clients don't have to wait for a response to keep processing.

I took a few hours last night (after reviewing my python socket programming) and ported Etsy's [PHP example](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/php-example.php) to Python. Until (and if) it gets pulled into the main repo, yo can find the python sample client in [my Github fork of statsd](https://github.com/sivy/statsd/blob/master/python_example.py).

    >>> from python_example import Statsd
    >>> Statsd.timing('some.time','500|ms')
    >>> Statsd.increment('some.int')
    >>> Statsd.decrement('some.int')

## Stand-alone Client

I reworked this code into a standalone client you can now find [on Github](https://github.com/sivy/py-statsd):

    >>> from pystatsd import Statsd
    >>> statsd_client = Statsd(host, port)
    >>> statsd_client.timing('some.time','500|ms')
    >>> statsd_client.increment('some.int')
    >>> statsd_client.decrement('some.int')

Enjoy!
