I recently gave a friend a resume to pass along for a linux sys admin position. It was a strange experience, thinking of myself as a systems administrator. But as I went through to tweak my resumee for the position, I realized that I&#39;ve done quite a bit of it over the years (as any web developer must).

<a href="http://www.artlabeurope.com">Back in &#39;96</a> I helped set up and maintain a FreeBSD web and file server. I maintained our teams email accounts on it (configuring and maintaining IMAP in the process), managed the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> web server and a dozen or so <a href="http://www.perl.org">perl</a> CGI scripts. I also managed the FTP services, and even re-compiled the kernel to add in AppleTalk support (didn&#39;t sleep much that night! *shudder*)

Later on I helped set up a linux webserver running Apache, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">tomcat</a>, and CVS for a team at <a href="http://www.compaas.net">Compass</a>.

<a href="http://www.uhaul.com">More recently yet</a> I managed a Mac OS X server running CVS, the usual net services (ftp, ssh, etc) and WebObjects. I also spent a lot of time automating the major boring stuff with a little help from my <a href="http://www.python.org">friends</a>.

Finally, I&#39;ve got opus, my own linux box, running here behind my firewall, automating stuff like <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkineticExtras/software/unix/2003/03/17/chainGangFetchmailProcmailEtc.html">processing my server logs</a>.

Gee, who knew? I still have a lot to learn, and I&#39;m glad for opus &#39;cause it gives me a platform to hack on.

It turns out I did not get the position (they used someone internally), but it did give me a new appreciation for what I&#39;ve learned over the years, and how much more I can learn - which gives me hope!
