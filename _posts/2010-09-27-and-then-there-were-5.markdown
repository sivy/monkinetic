The last three weeks have been some of the most intense in recent memory for me, filled with blessings and some sadness.

A month ago (!), Jodi and I learned that a young boy we had heard about back in April (from the foster system here in AZ) was available for adoption. We had sought to adopt him in April, but circumstances were not right and it didn't work out. This time around we were already certified to adopt in Arizona and the process went forward more smoothly - and more quickly - than we could have expected.

V. was placed with us 2 weeks ago as an adoptive placement; we'll be able to officially adopt him 6 months hence. The last 2 weeks have been especially intense emotionally as V. gets to know our family, and we, him! He's a sweet boy with a rambunctious streak who adores swimming more than anything else in the world right now (good thing we have a pool and the water is still around 80!) so we're spent a lot of time in the pool. I've started working with an architect (hi Dad!) to design a phased playground in the backyard. Partly cause playgrounds are fun, and also to give V. and I a project to work on together.

Things have not been all wine and roses -- introducing a new permanent member of the family at 7 isn't the easiest thing to do. V. and his new sisters are still getting acclimated, but a lot of fun is being had amidst the familial growing pains (there are 5 of us now!). Ultimately we know V. was meant to be in our family and we're excited to see what God is doing here!
