[This page](http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/1298/9812123.html) from the Washingon Report has a very enlightening review of a book published in 1998: The Origin of the Palestine-Israel Conflict. It touches a bit on salient facts about the establishment of the nation of Israel by the British, and the removal of the indiginous Palestinians. Hard stuff, and the current conflict comes as no surprise.

&gt;&quot;We shall try to spirit the penniless [Arab] population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our own country...Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.&quot;
&gt;--Theodor Herzl, founder of modern Zionism.
