Night wings, her hair chains, Here's your wooden greenback,

<p>Whoever posted this page about <a href="http://www.karekingoekjian.com/">Kerekin Goekjian</a>'s photography paired the images with lyrics from R.E.M.'s <em>Swan Swan H</em> from <em>Lifes Rich Pageant</em>, and it works beautifully.</p>

<blockquote>
Born into an Armenian shoemaker's family in Beirut, Lebanon, Goekjian moved to the United States in 1970. He is known for his images of southern ruins photographed by moonlight and lightpainted with strobes and flashlights.

<p>I'm fascinated by how people pair music and images.</p>
