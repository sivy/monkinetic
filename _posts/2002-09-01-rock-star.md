A long time ago, I obtained some of the coolest silver metallic fabric. I wanted a <i>Silver Shirt</i>. A real, wild, back-beat bouncing techno thrashing <i>Silver Shirt</i>...

Well, last year Jodi snuck off with my swath of silver fabric and spirited it away to Florida, where it was given unto her grandmother, she of the <i>Magic Sewing Machine</i>. Come last Christmas, Jodi presented me with The Shirt. It was silver, it flowed like water, it makes you want to go clubbing just to put it on.

I decided to wear it to the rehearsal for my brother&#39;s wedding last week. It was awesome.

<i>Update</i>: Jodi reminds me that I <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/814">posted about</a> the <i>Silver Shirt</i> right after i got it last Christmas. Now you can see it!
