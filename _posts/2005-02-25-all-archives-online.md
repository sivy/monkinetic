I finally got around to importing all the content from my old EditThisPage.com site. Thanks to the <a href="http://frontier.sourceforge.net">open-source release of Frontier</a>, I was able to open my old redmonk.root and write a quick (1 hour due to extremely rusty usertalk - thanks for the help <a href="http://truerwords.net">Seth</a>) export script to RSS 2.0. I then used the import-rss.php script included with |WordPress| 1.5 to suck it all into the blog. Nice!

You can find the new content on the <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives-by-month/">Archives By Month</a> page, Dec 1999 - June 2000. Beware, I haven&#39;t done much cleanup, so there are likely artifacts in the content leftover from its genesis in <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a> (double-quotes on random words and phrases, &lt;font> tags - *shudder* - etc.)
