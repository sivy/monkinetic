Jodi [celebrates](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/08/24/happy-independence-day-ukraine) Ukraine's Independence Day, complete with pictures from our 2005 day on the [Maidan Nezalezhnosti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidan_Nezalezhnosti) with the crowds.

How appropriate that we're [headed to Russia](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/08/23/adoption-trip-details) for our first trip (of two) for a new adoption 2 years after we were last overseas for Addy's adoption. Here's hoping that Vladivostok will occupy a similar place in our hearts as Kiev does.
