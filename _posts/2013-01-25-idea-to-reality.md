Title: From Idea to Reality
Date: 2013-01-25 07:16

Back in September, I posted about an idea I had while commuting to work: [DropDownMarkBox](http://www.monkinetic.com/2012/09/25/dropdownmarkbox) describes my frustration with publishing times on [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am) (an otherwise fine and good looking service) and how I thought I might build a similar system.

4 months later, working in my limited spare time, [Markbox](http;//markbox.io) is a reality, in Beta, and getting better.
