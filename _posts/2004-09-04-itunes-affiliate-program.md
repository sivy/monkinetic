Title: iTunes Affiliate Program
layout: post

Ok, so I signed up for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/">iTunes Music Store affilliate program</a> to see what all the hoopla is about. So far I&#39;m not impressed - the only options for links that are available are an iTunes logo that links to the <abbr title="iTunes Music Store">iTMS</abbr>. I&#39;m hoping that they will add a way to link to specific products, like you can with Amazon&#39;s affiliate program. This would make so much more sense in the context of a weblog site, what with all the &quot;what I&#39;m listening to&quot; links out there.

Anyway, we&#39;ll see how it plays out.
