I&#39;ve never really considered myself an information architect, but I&#39;ve done quite a bit of work that would fall into that category over the years. Jesse James Garrett has an excellent article titled <a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/">A visual vocabulary
for describing information architecture and interaction design</a>. I&#39;ve just printed it out and will be perusing offline for a few days.<p>

Both diagramming tools I&#39;ve used on Mac OS X (<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">Graffle </a>and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/glyphix">Glyphix</a>) give me the ability to create custom libraries of symbols, that would be perfect for this. However, they are also both limited demo-ware, so I need to cough up about a hundred bucks for the privilage.<p>

On the flip-side, having to use Microsoft Visio instead is almost enough reason to do it anyway.</p></p>
