<a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Doug Bowman</a>, designer and css guru, published <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/throwing_tables/">yet another article</a> dedicated to getting those of us who have not gone the "standards-compliant" route on our sites to make the leap.

>There's no longer any reason to use tables for layout, nor is there reason to maintain multiple versions of a site solely for different desktop browsers. Throw the tables out first. Trust us, they're not needed anymore.

God, how I wish I could believe him.

You see, my company has clients whose customers are instructors found in educational institutions across the country, from Harvard to such-and-so community college. These are often non-technical users - though intelligent and *very vocal* - at least 3% of which are using some form of Netscape Navigator 4.x.

These users do *not* want to see something like what you see here, which is Doug's site rendered in the aforementioned browser, and they are unlikely to be willing - or even permitted - to install a new web browser on their computer just to complete a business transaction with us.

Believe me, I would *love* to move completely to a standards-compliant layout, brandishing my delete-key like a samurai's katana, slicing open tables and gutting pages in an honorable fury. But until I can justify to our clients that those 3% of decision-makers *don't count*, and that the negative word-of-mouth a crappy-looking site will generate won't hurt them *that much*, I've got to stick with tables and spacer-gifs.

Any other opinions?
