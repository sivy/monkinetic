I&#39;ve switched the news box on the right of this page to suck in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/webobjects-newbies/messages?rss=1&amp;viscount=15">RSS feed</a> of the WebObjects-Newbies mailing list on Yahoo! Groups.

Unfortunately, they&#39;ve got some issues with how the links are generated, so none of the links work. I&#39;m going to leave it for a little while hoping they&#39;ll fix the it... if not, I&#39;ll switch back to the Moreover Web Technologies feed.
