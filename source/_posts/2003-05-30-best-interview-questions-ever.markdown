Ok, so I&#39;ve been working on getting an interview with a web/IT company in So. Cal. Today I got an email from one of their staff, with a first round of questions.

Alright... let&#39;s test your mettle...

REM for $100:<br />

Scripting Languages for $200:<br />
Often referred to as &quot;LISP for dummies,&quot; this scripting language&#39;s three letter name is a homonym for an action that produces laughter.

All things Macintosh for $500:<br />
This computer manufacturer, known for creating supercomputers, did all of its design work on Apple computers.

The answers, you ask? Well, ok.
<ul><li>He actually had me stumped on the first question, and being a big R.E.M. fan I&#39;m eternally ashamed I don&#39;t know the answer. But then again, neither does <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, so I don&#39;t feel <i>too</i> bad.</li>
