Ok, this is not going to happen often, so all you left-wingers out there listen up! -) Rafe over at <a href="http://www.rc3.org/">rc3.org</a> <a href="http://www.rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=3852">is right</a>. Er, left. Er, correct:
<blockquote>Democratic Senator Russ Feingold has won me over to his way of thinking. ... Feingold argued that Ashcroft should be confirmed because the President has the right to get the cabinet he wants. If we give the President free rein to choose his cabinet, then we&#39;re free to judge his administration on the actions undertaken by that cabinet.</blockquote>

The same goes for a lot of government officials. If Congress would stop making it their business to choose the rest of the Government, we might have a chance to see what works and what doesn&#39;t. What I mean: an incoming administration claims it stands for X,Y, and Z, and gets elected. Then Congress says &quot;We don&#39;t like X and Y - we won&#39;t let you pick/appoint people who believe X and Y.&quot; Therefore the administration becomes a mix of ideologies and lowest-common-denominator politics, followed by lots misinformation and mixed messages. 

When the messages and results can be clearly attributed to the foundational beliefs of the [particular branch of government] then the people will be better able to select the government they want.

I&#39;ll add this: this goes for politicos on <i>both</i> sides of the aisle. I&#39;m sick of all of &#39;em.
