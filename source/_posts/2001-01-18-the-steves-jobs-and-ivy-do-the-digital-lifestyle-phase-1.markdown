At Macworld SF, Steve Jobs layed out <a href="htp://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>&#39;s vision for itself and the future of the Macintosh. In a 15 minute section of his <a href="">keynote</a>, he described the <a href="http://www.apple.com/enews/2001/01/11enews1.html#article1">digital lifestyle</a>, where our Macs become &quot;Digital Hubs&quot; that route information and media between the new generation of digital devices that are becoming more and more commonplace.

I perked up at this - this is how I&#39;ve always believed things would shape up, and while various computer products have appeared to enable this kind of integration and convergence, it&#39;s good to see this as a core part of Apple&#39;s vision. 

As a result, I&#39;ve made some changes at home and work, in order to begin to shape some new habits. In no particular order:

<li>AppleScript - a core of my new DL strategy. I&#39;ve done some over the years with Applescript, but after two sessions at MWSF with Sal Saghoian, AppleScript product manager, I&#39;m stoked on some new possibilities. Think Voice. ;-)

<li>Palm - I&#39;ve revived my Palm V, and after discovering that the Palm Desktop is emminently scriptable, am going to start hacking that to my own productive ends.

<li>I&#39;m running Mac OS 9 again at home as my main OS (I was on OS X full time) so I can take more full advantage of my scriptable apps. I&#39;ll switch back full time once OS X ships, as the important bits of Apple&#39;s new OS will be scriptable out-of-the-box.

<li>I&#39;ve upgraded my work Mac to OS 9, from 8.6. Big differences. This was mainly for compatibility with my home environment.

<li>I&#39;ve started (ok, it&#39;s a bit of a lark) working on an applescript-based digital assistant named Ziggy (for now). Ziggy is an interesting experiment in Mac Text-To-Speech and Speech Recognition. He&#39;s not too bright yet, though. ;-)</li></li></li></li></li>
