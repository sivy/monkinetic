~stevenf [wrote a post](http://stevenf.com/mt/2006/02/put_a_voodoopad_wiki_on_your_treo.php) about how he&#39;s using [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) to store information on his Treo. Very neat. I&#39;ve become a VoodooPad junkie as well, and -- while it&#39;s not as neat as Steven&#39;s trick -- I have a little trick I&#39;ve whipped up to export a voodoopad document as a singel bookmarks page that I use as my browser&#39;s homepage. 

I hacked the template and stylesheet of the included GMDC Blog plugin, so that all the pages that are linked from the document&#39;s index get included in the home page (the original plugin does this) but I stripped it down so that the blocks of links wrap to the page width.

Then I wrote an Applescript that lives in VoodooPad&#39;s script menu that exports the document to /Library/WebServer/Documents/, using my plugin. Now whenever I want some new link available, I drop it in bookmarks.vdoc, and exportBookmarks. Easy.

Oh, I also mark all my stuff up as Markdown, and export the content as such (a setting in the export window).

Download the plugin: [GMDCHack](http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/2006/02/GMDCHack.vpwebexport.zip)

My export script:
