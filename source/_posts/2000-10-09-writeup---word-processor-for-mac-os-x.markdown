One app I&#39;m eagerly awaiting on &quot;Mac OS X&quot; is <a href="http://www.afstrade.com/products/WriteUp/Default.htm">WriteUp</a>, from <a href="http://www.afstrade.com/">Anderson Financial Systems</a>. WriteUp is an excellent word processor, and has been available on just about every iteration of NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and Rhapsody; there should be a version for Mac OS X available by the end of October, as evidenced <a href="http://www.afstrade.com/products/WriteUp/download.html">here</a>.
