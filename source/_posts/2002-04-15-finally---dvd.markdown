Well, we&#39;ve been building a small DVD library, today we finally decided on a DVD player. Amazon is running a sale on DVD players, and we had a gift certificate (for Christmas last year) from Jodi&#39;s brother. So we got this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005AY8R/qid=1018847956/br=1-2/ref=br_lf_e_2/104-6988275-2499954">Toshiba SD4700</a>. It plays DVD-Video, DVD-Audio, CD, MP3, CD-R/RW and DVD-R, so I think it&#39;s going to grow as our system does.
