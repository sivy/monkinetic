Derek Powazek [remembers](http://powazek.com/posts/2981), and offers a strange, beautiful explanation for, one of my favorite R.E.M. songs, _Swan Swan H_. (It's listed as 'Swan Swan H' on the album tracklist, but everyone calls it 'Swan Swan Hummingbird' after the first three lyrics.) I too learned to play the song, and while I don't have the same associations Derek does with the tune (it can only be described as haunting), it is one that has always touched me deeply.

And damn, Derek:

>I jumped out of bed and drew this on the whiteboard in the hallway,

Whiteboard in the hallway: what a nerd. \*jealous\*

I'll leave you with a teaser for Derek's theory on the meaning of the song title:
