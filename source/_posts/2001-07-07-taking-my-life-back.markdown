Well, it looks like I&#39;m going to be buying a pickup from my brother-in-law, and this morning I bought a <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/516">mountain bike</a>. Finally! I got it pretty cheap, and it&#39;s a decent bike. Jodi&#39;s going to want me to spend some time getting her bike up to speed, then we can start riding together. ;-) I think we&#39;re going to also start going to the <a href="http://www.virginiabeachrockgym.com/ROCKGYM/home.htm">rock gym</a> again.<p>

I think some of this is precipitated by the fact that I just turned 30, but more it&#39;s getting back to the real me. I grew up on a bike, riding everywhere. I also started climbing 7 years ago, and loved it - as an asthmatic I didn&#39;t do a lot of sports growing up, but rock climbing is a slow, deliberate test of strength and balance. I took to it easily and love it. I then spent three years in Europe, living like a student, not getting out at all. After that I got married, and got a geek job (which did not afford me a lot of exercise during the day).<p>

Anyway, I&#39;m going to take my life back from complacency and lethargy.</p></p>
