Aquaminds has just released <a href="http://www.aquaminds.com/product.jsp">NoteTaker 2003</a>, a most cool outliner and organizer. NoteTaker lets you define sections and pages (outlines) in your notebook document, maintains a table of contents (also an outline) and lets you drag most any kind of file into it. It also help you maintain quite a list of metadata, and record audio bits too (which you can then drag out of the outline as mp3 files). This is really cool, and I&#39;m going to explore some more.

You can get a <a href="http://www.aquaminds.com/download.jsp">7 day trial copy</a>, the app is $69.95.
