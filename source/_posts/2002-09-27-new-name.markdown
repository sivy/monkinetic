As I&#39;ve gotten closer to the 1.0 release of Sid, I&#39;ve been thinking about the application&#39;s name. While Sid is interesting in a vague sort of way, I&#39;ve had trouble coming up with a decent icon, or brand, for the app. So over the last couple days I&#39;ve been pondering a new name. Jodi and I were brainstorming last night, and one of our ideas was &quot;Podium&quot; - a place to get your message out. Not too shabby for a weblog tool perhaps?

Today as a way of exploring the idea, I spent some time working on an icon/logo for it:

<div align="center"><img src="http://media.redmonk.net/images/podiumLogo.gif" /></div>

So - does it work? Should I go back to the drawing board? What do you think?
