Back in the day (1994), we had to get our R.E.M. information from the listserv (that's email for you kids) run out of Lynchburg College in Virginia.

I've carried this manila folder containing the R.E.M. FAQ and 3/4" of lyrics around from place to place while finishing college, working in Europe, getting engaged, married, moving 3 times, adopting 3 kids, to [the day R.E.M. broke up](http://remhq.com/news_story.php?id=1446).

This was how I learned to love them and their music, and I'm never getting rid of it.
