I want to fire [Cox Communications](http://cox.com/).

We currently have our phone, internet, and digital cable service through Cox, and have been largely happy with them. But we are now interested in getting the HD/DVR service (we have [TiVo](http://tivo.com) now and we are NOT going back to a life of watching tv in real-time :-P) and the cost of our current bundle plus the new services is climbing past what I&#39;m comfortable paying.

What I really want is less phone service (the bundle we have includes a bunch of phone services we never use) with *a proportionate decrease in cost*. But the way Cox&#39;s bundle is designed, any change in any of the 3 bundled services (other than adding additional services) nullifies the $27 &quot;savings&quot;, which means you pay $27 more for your 3 services and any decrease in cost you might achieve by choosing a lower level of service is eaten up by the increase in cost for the other services.

This makes me nuts. This attitude that Cox has a right to my money (&quot;you can pay $n for more services or $n for less services; either way you pay $n.&quot;) is insulting.

So I find myself wanting to escape Cox&#39;s monopolistic behavior, but I don&#39;t know where else to look for my services, and I don&#39;t know If i can get what I want anywhere else. Here&#39;s what I&#39;d like:

   1. Broadband internet. I have ~6mbs cable from Cox.
   2. HD TV service with a DVR.
   3. Basic phone+voicemail

I&#39;m going to look at [Qwest](http://qwest.com), though I&#39;ve heard horror stories about their customer service. Qwest seems to have a digital tv service, as well as some relationship with [DirecTV](http://directv.com), which appears to have some sort of HD/DVR service, but I have not figured out yet if you can get the whole HD/DVR combo through Qwest. Other than Qwest I have no idea what my options are. [Dish Network](http://www.dishnetwork.com) perhaps? Leave tips in the comments.
