Thanks to Google's "Search 2001" special feature, I can point out that at one time, [this site](http://redmonk.net) was the top "[redmonk](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=%22redmonk%22&btnG=Search)" (link will be live for only one month) and [redmonk.com](http://redmonk.com) was [selling christmas products](http://web.archive.org/web/20010516030906/www.redmonk.com/). 

(Sorry [James](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/)! :-P)
