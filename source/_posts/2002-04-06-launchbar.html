I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a>  from <a href="http://www.obdev.at/">Objective Development</a> for a few weeks now. All I can say is... *DAAamn*. That&#39;s a FINE pice of software. Launchbar indexes all your applications and documents (all configurable) and then gives you access to each of them in as little as 3 keystrokes.

Cmd-shift activates LB, then usually typing the first two or three letters of an application will select it. Hitting enter launches it. Didn&#39;t get the right app? Next time, instead of hitting enter, pick the right one from Launchbar&#39;s dropdown menu, *then* hit enter. After that, LB will launch the one you want. It learns, in a surprisingly efficient way, what you want it to do. Rock on!
