I was emailing with Seth this afternoon about the link traffic our  respective sites get, and he commented:
<blockquote>&quot;you don&#39;t say much about your job hunt, the little projects you must be doing to keep yourself busy and sharp, or your cycling.&quot;</blockquote>

Ok, smarty pants! -) Here goes: My job hunt sucks. The <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2002/08/12#item1389">interview I had</a> went ok, not great - there were some obvious gaps in my experience and knowledge that kept me out of it. I don&#39;t blame the company at all - they have the ability to  hire the cream of the crop and I wasn&#39;t it. No hard feelings.

On a related note, I&#39;m working on a web app right now that is going to play the role as sample code in an upcoming application to the same company, just so I&#39;m in their files. The app is something I started back when I was first learning <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/">WebObjects</a>, and news aggregators were still a novelty. -) This is the app that is keeping my Java/WebObjects skills going. I also spent some time refreshing my servlets knowledge by writing some weblog software. Big surprise there. Heh.

Finally, my cycling is at a dead stop due to a flat tire and lack of a patch kit. I know it&#39;s a lame excuse and once I get back from my trip east for my brother&#39;s wedding, I&#39;ll be fixing it.

So there, Seth! Happy? -)
