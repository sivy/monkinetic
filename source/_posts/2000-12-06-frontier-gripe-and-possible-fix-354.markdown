So I&#39;m waiting for Userland &quot;Frontier&quot; to recieve a database update, through it&#39;s nifty &quot;XML-RPC&quot;-based update feature. Problem is, it&#39;s been months since I updated this copy of Frontier, and the update is 10500K. Yikes! Frontier&#39;s status message tells me that it&#39;s receiving the data, but doesn&#39;t tell me how far it&#39;s along in the process. 

Now, Userland has been working on a nifty extension to Frontier&#39;s outliner called <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>. Radio Userland does some cool tricks with outlines, and since this functionality is ostensibly being moved back up the chain into Frontier, there presents itself a possible solution:

Once that outlining magic is in Frontier, when I request updates, first send me an outline of all the new parts I&#39;m going to get. Let me select which parts to get, then remove them from the outline as they&#39;re imported. When the outline is empty, I&#39;m up-to-date.
