<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt">David Hyatt, Safari Master</a>, writes about a new feature of Safari 1.3 (in development): 

<blockquote>One of the new features added to WebCore is an HTML wrapper for the Cocoa NSSearchField, which means you will be able to use this control in your Web pages and Dashboard widgets.

...

The search control will also even degrade gracefully in other browsers, since they won't recognize the unknown type and so will just use a text field instead.</blockquote>

This just sounds so stinkin' cool, yet I can't help but be reminded of the Bad Ol' Days&trademark; when each browser had their own unique HTML elements... Thoughts?
