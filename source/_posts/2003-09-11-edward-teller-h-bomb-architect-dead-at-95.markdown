Someone mentioned to me today that Edward Teller was dead. I had no idea who Edward Teller was, or why (or if) I should be pleased (as this person seemed to be) that he was dead.

Then I noticed that Dave had linked to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/10/obituaries/10TELL.html?ex=1378612800&amp;en=527a0430768a87c7&amp;ei=5007">New York Times obit on Teller</a>.

Edward Teller was a proponent and architect of the <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb7.htm">hydrogen bomb</a>, a thermo-nuclear device and the successor to the weaker atom bomb.

According to the NYTimes piece, Teller was a mathemetician of Hungarian descent who started in pure research, was asked to become part of Oppenheimer&#39;s atom bomb team at Los Alamos, and eventually pushed for and started the Lawrence Livermore Lab in San Fransisco as a facility to pursue the creation of a hydrogen bomb.

Considering his conservative politics, especially before and during the Cold War, and his chosen profession, I can see why many vilify this man. He did not argue against using nuclear devices against Japan, yet expressed afterwards that &quot;doing so had been a mistake&quot;, and wished that a non-destructive use could have been made of the devices. He also ruined Oppenheimer&#39;s career during the McCarthy era by testifying that Oppenheimer was unreliable and causing his security clearance to be revoked.
