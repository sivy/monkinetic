Jodi and I went to the central <a href="http://phoenixlibrary.org/web/">Phoenix Library</a> today, to pick up several books. We left with the two I needed, plus one other of interest: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374253846/redmonknet-20/104-4315644-0661538">That Same Flower</a>, by Jostein Gaarder (<a href="http://www.edsbookreview.com/general/gaarder_that_same.html">review</a>). 

Jostein Gaarder made a big impression on me in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425152251/redmonknet-20/104-4315644-0661538">Sophie&#39;s World</a>, a fantastic and novel (literally) trip through western philosophy. His writing style is very creative, and at the same time very educational.

That Same Flower is (supposedly - it&#39;s hard to tell) a translation of a long-lost letter to St. Augustine from his anonymous lover, mentioned several times in his   <a href="http://www.stoa.org/hippo/">Confessions</a>. It brings up topics of life, love, women, and medieval (and modern) Christianity. I&#39;ve read about half of it so far (it&#39;s quite short) and it *is* intriguing. I&#39;ll try and post more when I&#39;ve finished it.
