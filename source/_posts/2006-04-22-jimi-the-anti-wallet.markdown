After [Merlin posted](http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/19/jimi-wallet/) about [this cool little get-simple wallet](http://www.thejimi.com/wallet/index.php), I had to have one. My old leather hip-brick is beginning to cause chiropractic problems, and I&#39;m all about getting simple these days.

I showed |Jodi| the link first, and she immediately told me which two colors I had been deciding between. :-)

*I love having someone special who knows my tastes that well.*
