Heh. I acquired a 2.2 hour recording today from one of my favorite German trance techno DJ&#39;s, Gary D. It&#39;s a mind-blowing trip -- listening takes me back to a 6+ hour show he put on in a small club in northern Germany back in &#39;96 or so that was as fun as it was exhausting. If you like hard trance (which I do) his stuff is sublime. Curious as to whether he ever made it out of Europe, I Google&#39;d him and found his website, <a href="http://www.dtrance.com/index2.html">D.TRANCE</a>. Whew! It&#39;s as bright as the music is loud!
