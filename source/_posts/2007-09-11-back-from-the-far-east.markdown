So, Jodi and I are back from the [Far East](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Vladivostok), and Jodi has been writing about the trip ([Day 1](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/09/08/day-1-meeting-our-referral-sept-4), [Day 2](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/09/08/day-2-ups-and-downs-sept-5), [Day 3](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/09/08/day-3-we-say-yes-sept-6)). For those of you who don't know, we traveled to Vladivostok, Russia to meet our prospective daughter. We had some basic information about her - deaf, mild CP, 2.5 years old - but were able to get her full medical information after we got the referral. We went back and forth with our doctor a bit trying to determine Annna's actual medical situation, but eventually decided that there was nothing there that would keep us from adopting her, and so we're going forward! For more details, [check out](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net) Jodi's writeup.

We're pretty jet-lagged still, but what a great trip! Anna is adorable, a real cutie, and we're excited to continue the process of adopting her. (You can check out our [.mac gallery](http://gallery.mac.com/azivyfamily#gallery) as well).
