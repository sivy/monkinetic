My 8 year-old son is left-handed in a family of right-handers, and I'm looking for tips to help him make the most of it without feeling like the odd-man-out. Neither of his siblings care, so I'm not worried about him taking flak at home, but he's picked up a variety of techniques for doing things and I want to know how to best help him. He writes and eats left-handed, but kicks right-footed. He throws a frisbee ambidextrously (though throws stronger left-handed, but prefers right-handed). He plays violin right-handed. It's very strange.

For Christmas, we're getting him a 36" student guitar that I could get strung left or right handed. I'll teach him to play, but I'm not sure whether to encourage him to play leftie or rightie. Thoughts?
