Ok, so, having really learned nothing from my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/516">first venture out</a> on the Green Machine (affectionately monikered by it&#39;s current owner), I got the bike home last night and took it out for another jaunt. This one was a slightly longer trek - about 5 miles, all in the name of filling up the tires. The filling station down the street from me only had the for-pay ($0.50) air pumps, and I wasn&#39;t about to pay for air. <p>

So I started down the way to find another station. about 2 miles later I hit an Exxon, this one also only having the pay-for-air pumps. <i>Sigh</i>. I was already tired at this point (did I mention I&#39;m out of shape?) so I decided to go for it. <p>

I got change from the cashier, and proceeded to top off the front tire. So sweat. The rear tire, which was only a bit spongy, was to prove to be a real PITA. The stem on the innertube was loose, so I fought with the pump and the stem and ended up letting most of the air out of the tire before managing to get it about half filled. I gave up and headed home on an almost-flat tire, which made the 2.5 miles back pretty slow!<p>

All in all though - I had fun, got some badly needed exercise, and made sure I won&#39;t forget to get the schrader-valve attachement for my 125 psi compressor at home!</p></p></p>
