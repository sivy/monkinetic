Ok, I&#39;ve kept quiet about this so far, becuase it&#39;s been blogged to death elsewhere. But I&#39;m having fun playing with my $500 fantasy dollars and 1000 shares of monkinetic stock over at <a href="http://www.blogshares.com">BlogShares.com</a>.

What I want to know is how BlogShares tracks links. My page for monkinetic says that I have 12 incoming links and 25 outgoing links. 

I have more than 25 links just in my blogroll. Are the links listed on BlogShares limited to sites in BlogShare&#39;s index? And Technorati currently lists <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&amp;url=www.redmonk.net%2Fmonkinetic">23 inbound links</a> to my site.

Anyone have more info?

&lt;shameless plug&gt;Oh, and if you&#39;re playing, <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/buy.php?blog=http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">buy monkinetic</a> stock. smile Or link to me.&lt;/shameless plug&gt;

(short time passes as Steve makes sure he can&#39;t find the info on his own before posting...)

Ok, found some info in BlogShares&#39; FAQ:

&quot;<a href="http://www.blogshares.com/faq.php?cat=2#4">4.  I have more links on my homepage than BlogShares has listed.  Where are they?</a>&quot;

Doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> answer the question, but I thought I&#39;d point to it.
