This is, in fact, not a sarcastic comment on the Americanization of the world. In the process of moving to Phoenix, I&#39;ve apppreciated the fact that I can go to a Target, a Walmart, or a Blockbuster and know how it works. <p>

There are frighteningly dark sides to this convenience, and many parallels in the software world that are just as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">frightening</a>. But for the moment, as I hang my shower curtain from <a href="http://www.target.com">Target</a>, and watch my movies from <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a>, I&#39;m diggin&#39; it.</p>
