Nokia [shuts down their Apple Store ripoff](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/telecoms/article6948006.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=1185799), which should be no surprise. Just as using "Open" or "Green" in your marketing campaign doesn't make your product any more Open or Green, ([open-washing](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/07/21/parsing-the-open-in-adobes-open-source-media-framework-announcement/), [green-washing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwash)), Apple-Washing (Jobs-Washing?) may be the act of trying to capture the excitement of Apple's product experience by putting your products in a [spacious, well-lit, stainless steel and white plastic, glass-enclosed retail store](http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/24/microsoft-retail-store-opening-in-az-copies-freely-from-apple-st/).

As [Gruber says](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/12/07/nokia-london):

>[Apple's] stores are well-designed, and they do use clever tricks to make them even better, but the foundation is the products.

Think about it this way: an Apple store *is an Apple product*, not just a place to sell them.
