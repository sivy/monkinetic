I&#39;ve been getting a lot of &quot;referers&quot; lately from an unnamed website, so I went in search of ways to block, or at least annoy, them. I found this article from Ed Costello on <a href="http://epcostello.net/articles/2004/05/blocking_referer_spam.php">Blocking Referer Spam</a>. I&#39;ve implemented a variation on one of his techniques, targetted at this particular spammer. Now to see if it helps.
