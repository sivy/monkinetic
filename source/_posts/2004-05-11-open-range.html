Jodi and I watched <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/open_range/">Open Range</a> this weekend. I had heard good things about it, and had read some good reviews (esp. one at <a href="http://www.chud.com">C.H.U.D.</a> that I can&#39;t seem to find now). The movie was quite good; even Jodi, who&#39;s not typically a fan of westerns, thought so. The cinematography is amazing -- lots of sweeping views of georgeous rolling hills and skies. Open Range is not an &quot;exciting&quot; movie, for the most part, but as one reivew put it, it doesn&#39;t &quot;fade&quot; either - it seems to get more engaging as it goes.

The final running gunfight in town is, well, brutal. It&#39;s not gory, and there&#39;s no Die Hard-style glory shots. The gunshots are deep, loud, and short -- no echoing richochets stuck in for effect. Guns leave smoke and dust, and that guy getting hit with a double barrel shotgun through the side of a building goes down hard. No dramatics, just *BOOM* thump.

For once, Costner&#39;s acting is suitable to the role, and Robert Duvall is all man, and all class. Early on in the film, after a storm, Spearman (Duvall) goes out and rounds up 6-8 scattered horses by himself. Mose (<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0072344/">Abraham Benrubi</a> of E.R.) says to Charley (Costner): &quot;That man sure can cowboy.&quot; Charley replies: &quot;Yeaup. God broke the mold after him.&quot; Same goes for Duvall.

All in all, Open Range isn&#39;t a be-all-end-all western, but it was solid and enjoyable.
