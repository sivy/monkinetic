Napster, KaZaA. Convenient but is stealing.

No legal alternative.

What about PressPlay or Rhapsody? Subscription and limited. Boo!!

&quot;These services treat you like a criminal.&quot; Subscriptions are the wrong path. We&#39;ve bought our music for as long as we can remember - we want to own the music.

Apple Music Store. Music downloads done right. Need broad right set of rights from music companies.

Talked to Warner, then Universal... landmark deals with big 5.

One-click downloads, Search, Browsing - Genre Artist Album)

Question: Can independents get on this service? If Apple wants to kick ass, make it easy for independent artists to sign up and sell their music.
