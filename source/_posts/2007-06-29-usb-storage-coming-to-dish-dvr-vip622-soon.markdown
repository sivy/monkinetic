[DBSTalk](http://www.dbstalk.com) posted an overview of [a recent customer chat with Dish Network CEO Charlie Ergen](http://www.dbstalk.com/showthread.php?t=89669). One cool nugget: USB Storage support may *finally* come to Dish&#39;s DVR:

<blockquote cite="http://www.dbstalk.com/showthread.php?t=89669">
<ul>
 <li> USB External Storage available late summer/fall</li>
 <li> USB Storage will have an activation charge but no monthly charge</li>
 <li> USB Storage will support &quot;virtually&quot; any USB drive</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Maybe I&#39;ll have a reason to get one of those multi-drive [Drobo](http://drobo.com/products.aspx) USB/RAID devices... &lt;evil grin>
