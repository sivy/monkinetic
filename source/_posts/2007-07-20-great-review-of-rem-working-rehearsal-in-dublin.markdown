&gt;[Thus is the pattern for the night established](http://www.cluas.com/music/gigs/rem-dublin-olympia-2007-4431.htm). A couple of new songs, a couple of oldies and shiny happy old me putting in a prize winning performance in the dancing while sitting down world championships. ... Everything else we don&#39;t know, though, is pretty much flawless, a raucous, breathtaking hybrid of the best bits from Reckoning and Monster.

W00!
