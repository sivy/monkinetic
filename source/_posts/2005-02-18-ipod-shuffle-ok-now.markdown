Jodi&#39;s iPod shuffle went *bork* the other day - we had connected it successfully to both her TiBook and my PowerBook and updated her music, but then after a few days it refused to be recognized by either machine. No lights, it didn&#39;t show up on the desktop or in iTunes, and System Profiler didn&#39;t see it on the USB bus. Wah. Just ot be sure I took some time and ran through the instructions on this <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@285.Y9KWaiMiQvc.0@.68a67c22/15">Apple Discussions post</a>, to no avail.

Sooooo, last night we took it to the Apple Store in Chandler, and waggled it at a Genius. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and said &quot;I can&#39;t make it do *anything*. Guess I&#39;ll have to replace it.&quot; Oh twist my arm. We left with a purty new (non kitty-cat-chewed) iPod shuffle. FYI: the replacement units come sans lanyards and end caps.

I got home, loaded the shuffle with my whole <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2</a> collection so Jjodi would ahve something to work out to, and left it to charge overnight.
