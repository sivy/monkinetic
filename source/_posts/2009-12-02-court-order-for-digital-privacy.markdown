I had a few thoughts in response to a twitter, um "thread" [on](http://twitter.com/monkchips/status/6272970298) [cloud](http://twitter.com/steveivy/status/6273163615) [computing](http://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/6279612477) and [privacy](http://twitter.com/steveivy/status/6280182370), with [Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog) and [James Governor](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor).

Just as law enforcement must present a court-ordered search warrant in order to enter your home, there ought to be an equivalent for non-public electronic records. Imagine if you will, that when the government requested [8 million GPS records from Sprint](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/surveillance-shocker-sprint-received-8-million-law), they were required to send a notification to every affected user a copy of a search warrant that included:

* entity requesting the data
* under whose authorization the warrant is issued
* probable cause
* specific search parameters (just as a normal warrant must describe property to be seized)
* notification of the user's rights under applicable law

Much of this ought to already be on a warrant somewhere in these cases. Seeing as how Sprint set up a custom government portal for this sensitive data, it should be easy to notify affected users. Thoughts?
