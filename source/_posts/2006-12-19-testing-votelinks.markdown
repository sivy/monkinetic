In a recent [24 Ways](http://24ways.org) entry, Jeremy Keith described how to <a href="http://24ways.org/2006/boost-your-hyperlink-power" rev="vote-for">Boost Your Hyperlink Power</a> through the use of the <code>a</code> tag&#39;s <code>rev</code> attribute and the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/vote-links" rev="vote-for">VoteLinks</a> microformat.

I thought that was pretty neat, so I first created some [VoteLinks icons](http://microformats.org/wiki/icons#VoteLinks), then wrote some jQuery code to look for rev=&quot;vote-for&quot; attributes on anchors on this page and add the vote-for icon to the link on mouseover. It&#39;s hacky right now, but after I get some smaller icons (LazyWeb alert!) it will not look as janky...

Oh, better test <a href="http://microsoft.com" rev="vote-against">vote-against</a> too. And here&#39;s a vote-for for <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/11/30/kuler-api-testing-continued/" rev="vote-for">a kuler API testing post</a> to test my Vote-Via-Trackback plugin. (Hm. back to the drawing board on that one.)

P.S. oh, my is it b0rk in Safari. Sorry, Mac brothers. Fixes once I can get some more time.
