Jim&#39;s just finished porting his <a href="http://www.tyrell.com">employer&#39;s website</a> to <a href="http://www.plone.org">Plone</a>, an open-source content management system. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to read more about it on Tyrell&#39;s <a href="http://www.tyrell.com/enterprise">Enterprise Corner</a> soon.


Jim built the recently-released <a href="http://www.plone.org/download">Mac OS X Plone installer</a>, the efficacity of which I can attest to, and contributed to Tyrell&#39;s port of the <a href="http://www.tyrell.com/enterprise/osx/opennms/index.html">OpenNMS network management system</a> to Mac OS X. Jim, you rock!
