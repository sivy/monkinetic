I've come to to love reading Wil Wheaton's blog: [WWdN: In Exile](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/). Today he describes meeting <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2007/08/briefly-recappi.html">a fan who worked 10 years to get autographs of the whole ST:TNG cast</a> - Wil was the last she needed:

>Oh! One of the top five moments? A woman waited in my autograph line after my performance and carefully set down a cast photo from season three. Everyone else had signed it, even Patrick and Brent.

>"You're the last one," she said, eyes gleaming. "I've been carrying this around for ten years to all these conventions, and I can't believe I'm going to finally finish it!"

>I signed it as carefully as I've ever signed anything, and when I finished, I looked up at her. Tears fell from her eyes.

>"Thank you so much!" She said.

>"Thank you," I said, "I'm honored that I got to be part of this moment."

Thanks for sharing that with us, Wil.

(Don't think the post title is creepy - I was a Trekker for many years, and I can easily recall the sense of wonder and awe that Roddenberry's universe inspired in me, dreams that _Enterprise_ tread on and crushed like so many bugs.)
