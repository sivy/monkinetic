Heading into the new year, Jodi and I have been working with our [bookkeeper](http://www.dasmahacct.com/) to re-categorize some of our expenses, and we're realizing that some of the costs associated with running a web service don't fit easily into standard accounting categories. If you're running a small business / web services company, how do you categorize the following?

* Subscription services like Github?
* Hosting services like Linode
* Domain name purchases
* SSL Certificate costs

Any guidance or ideas would be appreciated! Ping me [@steveivy](http://twitter.com/steveivy) on Twitter or steveivy at google mail, and I'll post a followup with the results.
