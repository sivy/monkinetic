<blockquote>[via <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Aaron Swartz: The Weblog</a>]  As you can see, copyright lengths go up as soon as Mickey gets a little too close to freedom. (<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000638">link</a>)</blockquote>

This is the reason I support the <a href="http://www.eldred.cc/">Free The Mouse</a> campaign. Whatever reason there may or may not be to modify copyright law, protecting Disney&#39;s (and anyone else&#39;s) over-ripe and stinky intellectual property ain&#39;t one of them.
