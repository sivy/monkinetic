This was a project weekend. There were a nummber of projects I&#39;d been slacking on, and finally got to working on Saturday and Sunday.

* L.T.&#39;s dresser, which used to look like <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/09/29/kid-furniture/">this</a>, has been completely stripped and this weeked got both a coat of primer and a coat of white high-gloss.
* The dresser also got a new top, thanks to Lowe&#39;s and a neighbor&#39;s router. Oh, and I managed to slice my finger open on the router bit. A trip to Ugent Care and some <a href="http://www.dermabond.com">Dermabond</a> later, I&#39;m back in business. Ew.
* We recently got a new sectional sofa, and ordered a new bed. The bed came in yesterday, and we picked it up and put it together. This, of course, meant re-arranging the master bedroom and moving pictures around the house.
* I also primed and started painting a set of shelves to go in LT&#39;s room.
* Plastered the hole in the back of LT&#39;s closet where I had to pull wire for the hall lights...

That seems to be it. Long weekend. Ready for the week. :-)
