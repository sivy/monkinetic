So, I thought I&#39;d do a short series on some of the sites I&#39;m subscribed to. The first one I want to mention is <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a>.

###What is this site?

Rands In Repose, <a href="http://randsinrepose.com">http://randsinrepose.com</a>. Rands is a manager at a Silicon Valley hi-tech firm (are there any other kinds of firms there?) and has over a decade of direct management under his belt. He writes from experience, and shares his losses with his wins, and tells you what to learn from them. As you&#39;ll see from the interview (below) he tells stories, and PEOPLE LIKE STORIES.
