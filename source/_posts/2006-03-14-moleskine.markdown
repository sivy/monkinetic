I just received my first Moleskine notebook. After opening it, and experiencing the quality of the cover, the leaves themselves, and the binding... I may never buy another brand of journal/notebook. My weapon of choice? The Large Plain Journal: 5x8, 120 pages, no lines. As I told |Jim|:

&gt;Steve: this is serious crack for office supply / paper fiends

Afterwards, I had to have new pens for my new notebook (new wineskins, anyone?) soi I headed to Staples and came from hence bearing a 4-pack of [UNI-BALL Get RT .38 Micro Points](http://www.uniball-na.com/main.taf?p=1,4,3)
