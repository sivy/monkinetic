Unfortunately, due to the recent discovery of an <a href="http://www.w00w00.org/advisories/aim.html">AIM exploit</a>, our firewall admin has closed off AIM. Smart move, except that the exploit is specific to the Windows version of the AOL Instant Messenger client - not clones, and not on non-Windows machines. I, on the other hand, use <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/adamiser/Adium/">Adium</a> on Mac OS X.<p>

Therefore, for now, if you need to get ahold of me you can use <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">email</a>.</p>
