Sorry, I did not get a chance to congratulate Dave on the tenth anniversary of [Scripting News](http://scripting.com).

<a href="http://scripting.com" rel="attachment wp-att-2497" title="Happy Birthday, Scripting News!"><img alt="cactus.gif" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36562970c" src="http://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b36562970c-pi" style="float: left; margin: 0 8px 8px 0;" /></a>

Congrats, Dave, and I&#39;m grateful for your pioneering spirit. I haven&#39;t always agreed with you, but you brought us Frontier, editing code in the outliner, the News Page suite, editthispage.com, and a constant stream of ideas, provocations, and exhortations on Scripting News. And I learned from all these things. Thanks Dave.

(BTW, Scripting News became a weblog on [February 1st, 1997](http://web.archive.org/web/19970219190206/www.scripting.com/stories/siteChanges.html), not April 1st. But it&#39;s Dave&#39;s world, we just live in it. :-P )
