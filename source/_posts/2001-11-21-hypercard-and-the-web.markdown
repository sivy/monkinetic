<i>What if you could design, create and edit a stack in a single outline? That&#39;s what I have working. Instead of the runtime being Hypercard, the runtime is the Web. </i><p>
I have a problem with this... I learned to program using HyperCard and HyperTalk. What Dave has working is HyperTalk in an outline, with placeholders for GUI elements. Frontier has a great outliner. I won&#39;t dispute it. But an outliner is not the place to develop visual interfaces.<p>

Dave also says: <i>Give this tool to a writer who loves writing, and all of a sudden the complexity lifts, for the user, because it&#39;s lifted for the writer.</i><p>

But HyperCard was not a writer&#39;s tool. A writer does not want to care about where stuff goes on the page. HC was a software developer&#39;s tool, used to create elegant, sophisticated multimedia applications. Yes, many people we developers would call &quot;users&quot; created awesome stuff in HyperCard; in doing so they were taking the role of developer.<p>

I love writing code in an outline. I even like creating presentations in an outline. But when it comes to mixing outlines and layout, I&#39;d have to say that <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/powerpoint.jpg">PowerPoint is the closest thing to HyperCard + MORE</a>. Granted there&#39;s no runtime, but that&#39;s the format I would want - outline and layout side by side.</p></p></p></p>
