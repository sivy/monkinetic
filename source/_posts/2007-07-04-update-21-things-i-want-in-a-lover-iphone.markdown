Updated from [my last list](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/10/30/21-things-i-want-in-a-lover-handheld-communications-device/), now that the [&quot;work of nearly indescribable beauty&quot;](http://apple.com/iphone) has been released:

* <strike style="color: #666;">Fits in a normal-sized pocket</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">A distinct absence of Windows(tm)</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">A navigation system based in user-experience reality</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Able to run, quickly, an appropriately standards-compliant web browser</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Likewise an email client</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Likewise some form or news/rss reader</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Has a decent camera (~2mp for mobile pics)</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Might as well play real music</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">And video, since it&#39;s MY list</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Sync all applicable content (contacts, feeds, bookmarks, music, video)</strike> with my *Macs* (Yes, more than one) (half points)
* <strike style="color: #666;">Bluetooth 2.0</strike>, compatible with Bluetooth keyboards &amp;/or mice (half points)
* <strike style="color: #666;">Capable of being managed with one hand for non-data-entry tasks</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Have a *usable* keyboard/thumbboard for data-entry/web/email/IM</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Is a Quad-band phone, since you never know where you&#39;r going to be</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">Multi-tasking capable (my rss reader, IM, and email better be able to work simultaneously)</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">A decent speaker so that my alerts (incoming call or otherwise) are crisp even when not loud</strike>
* <strike style="color: #666;">*Is itself a work of nearly indescribable beauty*</strike>

Still missing:

* Able to use a wifi connection for data *and* voice traffic when available
* Likewise a multi-protocol IM client
* A bright, 720 x 480 (or better) resolution screen
* Some form of presence management (busy/away/available/driving)
