So, Adam Curry&#39;s Daily Source Code has replaced NPR on my morning commute, and imagine my surprise to hear him mention me and <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/09/16/geekery-ahead/">my recent comments</a> about link resouces for audio posts in <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/2004/09/21.html#a6596">today&#39;s show</a>. 

Of course, the place I was listening today (approximately <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?ed=O.fp7Op_0Tr33r7k6mzcCeA3A672pNgJxrULc4QP6A--&amp;csz=mesa%2C+az&amp;country=us&amp;new=1&amp;name=&amp;qty=">here</a>) was the one place that having the links to resoruces mentioned on the show was of no use to me. However, I often listen to shows like Adam&#39;s or <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> while at work, and there I&#39;d love to have an inconspicious window (about the size of the minimized iTunes window) scrolling the URLs by as they are mentioned. 

I wonder how we can make this work?
