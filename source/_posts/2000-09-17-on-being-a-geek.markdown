<p><b><a name="mainHead1">On Being A Geek</a></b><br />
<p>Per <a href="http://bump.net">Rob O.</a>&#39;s recomendation, I ordered Jon Katz&#39; book &quot;Geeks&quot; (From Barnes and Noble) and started reading it tonight. My wife just finished &quot;Microserfs&quot; , by Douglas Coupland, and loved it. She&#39;s already started again. Why mention Microserfs? Because like &quot;Geeks&quot;, &quot;Microserfs&quot; deals with what makes me tick.<br />
<p>I loved &quot;Microserfs&quot;. Douglas Coupland&#39;s writing is personal, funny, ironic, and touching, all without going completely overboard. As a longtime nerd many things in Coupland&#39;s book touched a nerve in me.<br />
<p>Katz&#39; &quot;Geeks&quot; is turning out to be a whole different experience. &quot;Geeks&quot; takes the clean-LEGO world of &quot;Microserfs&quot; and rubs off the shine, exposing the pain and isolation of not fitting in, as well as the triumph of being indispensible to a new world of communication. Coupland&#39;s &quot;Microserfs&quot; is a novel, &quot;Geeks&quot; is simultaneously an expose and a manifesto, part reality-based television and part Declaration of Independence.<br />
<p>I&#39;ve only gotten through the first two chapters in &quot;Geeks&quot;. I think I&#39;ll have more to say later, but for now,<br />
