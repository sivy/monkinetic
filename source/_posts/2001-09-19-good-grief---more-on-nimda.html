The <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2095530,00.html">Nimda virus</a> uses IIS, Outlook, AND Internet Explorer. Um, HELO?? Ever wonder about the fact that ALL THREE of these products are made by one company?

&quot;This means that if you go and browse a page and you don&#39;t have the correct security on your browser, it looks as though the Javascript attempts to forward the virus from your machine to everyone in your contacts book.&quot; Cluley said the suspicion is that only Internet Explorer is vulnerable to this exploit...&quot;
