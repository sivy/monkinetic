I figured out a better solution for doing the audio blog thing. It&#39;s based somewhat on the system that Hugo Schotmann got going, and works pretty well. Dave Slusher is <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/audio/040927_03.writeback">using the same system</a> now for <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/">EGC</a>, and notes in his <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/09/27#040927_05">latest audio post</a> that there is some echoey stuff going on in the headphones. I had the same thing, but I think I got distracted by it, where Dave seems to have done just fine.

The trouble I&#39;m having right now is that the drive makes too much noise when chewing through audio data, and without a proper external mic, I get all kinds of whiney noise in the recording. Grr.
