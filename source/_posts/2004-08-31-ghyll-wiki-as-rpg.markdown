Morbus Iff, and a cast of thousands (for a very tiny definition of &#39;thousands&#39;), have <a href="http://www.gamegrene.com/node/397">released</a> a new <a href="http://gamegrene.com/">GameGrene</a> site, <a href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Main_Page">Ghyll</a>. Ghyll is a <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> where players take on the role of a scholar documenting the history of an imaginary world called Ghyll. Based on the concept documented <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html">here</a>, I think this is a really cool idea. Hypermedia rules.

&gt;Ghyll is different from previous Lexicons [...] because there is no pre-existing world for entries to derive from. We don&#39;t know if the world of Ghyll is fantasy, cyberpunk, sci-fi, horror, or all of the above. Ghyll is a blank slate, and will be defined and finessed by our entries. Anything goes until everyone knows.

Update: <a href="http://miscoranda.com/112">More on Ghyll</a> from it&#39;s other founder, Sean Palmer.
