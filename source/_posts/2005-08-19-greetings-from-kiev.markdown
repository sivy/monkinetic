Hi all, from our flat in Kiev, Ukraine! Our flat is right about the middle of <a href="http://www.ukraine.com/travel/maps05.html">this map</a>, on Zhytomers&#39;ka. We&#39;re about a 15 min. walk to the main Independence Square downtown.

But I&#39;m not here to chit-chat about our flat. To ge the real scoop on progress on the adoption, check out |Jodi|&#39;s blog. She has been faithfully posting for the <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/category/adoption-week-by-week/">50 weeks of preparation</a> for this trip, as well as the <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/category/adoption-journey/">journey itself</a>.

It has been an incredible journey so far. We have not yet &quot;found&quot; our children (read up on the process to understand what that really means) but we are going tomorrow for our <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index.php/archives/2005/08/18/1100-am-friday">third appointment</a> and are hopeful and trusting that God is in control.

Go on now, check out <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/">Speaks Her Mind</a>, and get the skinny!
