Last night, we had a bit of fun at the Ivy house. Jodi and I are taking a sign class, and we&#39;ve been trying to find time to practice, as well as give Adelina time to practice her sign as well. So last night after dinner, I announced that I was &quot;deaf&quot; for the night and that Adelina and Jodi would have to sign to me and vice versa.

(Now, please, if you are d(D)eaf, do not be offended... I fully realize that pretending to be deaf in order to practice sign is a weak substitute at best for seeking out opportunities to interact with the deaf community. But we&#39;re short on time and access to deaf events right now, so this will suffice.)

Jodi described it and recounted a funny story in an email to a friend:

&gt;We decided a good way to practice our ASL is to pick a night on occasion and assign one of us (me or Steve) to be deaf for the night.  Last night, Steve decided he was deaf.  It was a great experience.  He would completely ignore us if we forgot and tried to talk to him.  We had to tap him to get his attention, and Adelina kept telling me, &quot;Mommy, Daddy is deaf - he can&#39;t hear you!&quot;

&gt;After awhile, though, she got tired of it and wanted Steve to talk again, so we took a break. Then, it was bath time, so she took off her devices and got into the tub and then told him, &quot;you can be deaf again.  Now I&#39;m deaf, too.  We are BOTH deaf!&quot;  She was sooo cute!  And we are beginning to appreciate the idea of her understanding and valuing her deafness.
