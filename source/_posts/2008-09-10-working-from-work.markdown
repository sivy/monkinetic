One of the things I'm interested to ask the <span title="Working from home or other non-'work' location">[working from !work]</span> portion of the greater inter-verse about is: where *do* you work?

I plan on spending most of my time in my home office (affectionately referred to as "Six Apart Phoenix"), but it's always good (I'm told) to have a few places off site to repair to when the need for focus and/or space requires it. Options so far seem to include:

### The Local CoFi (coffee+wifi purveyor)

[SBUX](http://starbucks.com), or more likely, [Coffee Rush](http://coffeerush.biz/), which provides free wifi and cheaper lattes.

### The Local Co-Working Facility

[Gangplank](http://gangplankhq.com/) is a local shop that opens its doors for [co-working](https://coworking.pbwiki.com/). NIce guys, a Wii, etc.

### Looking for ideas/suggestions
