I&#39;m on the tail end of a 30-hour stretch at work. We had a major, multi-application deployment last night, with everyone from the network administrators to the programmers to the message board admin involved. It was a big deal, and of course my app decided to throw a tantrum precisely 2 minutes before we flip the switch.

Long story short, however, things got fixed, and this morning we opened my new apps to traffic. I&#39;m happy to report that they&#39;re humming along like champs, hardly even taxing the 700 mhz iMac they&#39;re running on. 

This is a major contrast to the last time I tried to deploy this app - when all hell broke loose. Thank God (really!) this time was different. Of course, each deployment has its share of terrifying moments, but I was talked down from the state of near-panic I found myself in at 9 pm last night, and things worked out better than I could have imagined.

Of course, there&#39;s still tomorrow morning&#39;s rush (from 4:30 to 7:00 AM) to watch out for, but I&#39;m not too worried.
