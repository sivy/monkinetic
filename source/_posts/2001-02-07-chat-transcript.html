ok, and the little box is saying that the WOReq is the parameter for that call<b><br />
JimRoepcke: </b><font color="#000000">the box in the parenthesis is the parameter 
to the message. the solid arrow points to the object being sent as that parameter.</font><b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>: </b>ok...<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> exactly<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> and the form data arrow just shows 
where the elements are going to get their value<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>: </b>from the formData NSDict<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>: </b>now wait a minute<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> form data arrow?<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> oh, right<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> the request always gets posted to 
the component it came from? which then decides what to send next?<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> right!<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> remember, the action method is called on current component, which 
returns the next component to return to the browser.<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> this is going to take some getting 
used to<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> no wonder WO developers go nuts when 
they have to work in another environment<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> it&#39;s like going back to assembler 
or something<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b>the action method is called on the SAME instance of your component 
class that was used to generate the page that the user just clicked on.<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> why do you think i&#39;m calling ASP Assembly Server Pages<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> got it<b><br />
monkinetic:</b> muahaha<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> Wo turns quite a few of my web dev 
paradigms on their heads<b><br />
JimRoepcke: </b>yup.<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> like what forms and app components 
do - i&#39;m used to forms pointing to the next page in line <b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> and having to stuff the page with as much shit as possible to 
make sure the next one gets what it needs.<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> it&#39;s almost like there are no &quot;pages&quot; 
in WO<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> <b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> with WO, you do all the &quot;stuffing&quot; and passing on the server side, 
not the client side. <b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> well, and the whole idea of a &quot;sending 
page&quot; and a &quot;recieving script&quot; are stood on end too<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> er, is stood on end<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> brb<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b>you get to think of the forms more like traditional gui forms, 
the values from your forms are just THERE, you don&#39;t have to do anything special 
to get the values into the forms and out of the forms. just bind the form elements 
to your objects and everything works.<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> that&#39;s the rub - WO was developed 
by application developers, who wanted to make it like cocoa programming<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b>i come from the traditional web development 
background<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> so i don&#39;t know what &quot;traditional 
gui forms&quot; are! ;)<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> just ignore that then.<b><br />
JimRoepcke:</b> all that matters is that all the grudge work in web development 
is done for you by WO.<b><br />
<font color="#ff0000">monkinetic</font>:</b> yeah... wow<b><br />
JimRoepcke: </b>drudge work, i meant, right </font>
