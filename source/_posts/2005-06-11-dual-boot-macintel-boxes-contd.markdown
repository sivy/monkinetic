Jim Roepcke <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2005/06/09#item7311">took me to task</a> for my previous comment about <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2005/06/07/another-reason-why-apple-switched/">dual-booting an Intel-based Mac with Windows</a>. I said:

&gt;Would make my life easier as a developer.

Jim responded: 

&gt;Easier? How? Easier as in, don&#39;t need to port your app to Mac OS X now?

&gt;Dual-boot is a dual-edged sword. The Mac could effectively be dead for gaming. Why would anyone spend the money to port a game to the Mac now when you can just say &quot;install Windows&quot;. Anyone who&#39;s spent enough money on a Mac good enough to run new games on is probably not going to flinch at spending the money to install Windows to play games.

&gt;Ditto for plenty of other Windows apps.

Jim makes a good point, though in my case I was referring to the fact that it would be convenient for testing web apps on Windows. However, on an Intel-based Mac, a product like VMWare would run Windows with near-native performance, so dual booting becomes a non-starter.

I do wonder sometimes what second- and third-order consequences this &quot;switch&quot; of Apple&#39;s will have...
